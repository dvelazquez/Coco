/*
   Multivariable controller and register for open and closed loop processes, it
   acquires a 1-5 VCD analog signal(PV) with an interfase based on an ADC0804. Sends
   a 4-20 mA analog signal to an I/P using a DAC. Commutation within ADC - DAC - PC
   is done through a tri-state buffer which it's selection is performed by two
   of the parallel port Control Lines.
